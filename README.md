2. 📝 Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. 🔑 Navigate to the **API Keys** section from the dashboard.
4. ➕ Click on the **Create API Key** button.
5. 📋 Copy the generated API key and store it securely, as you’ll need it for your application.

## Usage
1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Enter the file path**:
   When prompted, input the full path to the Python file you want to review (e.g., `sum.py`).

3. **Receive feedback**:
   The tool will read your code, send it to OpenAI for analysis, and display the feedback directly in the console.

## Example
Here’s a brief example of how to use the application:


1. Run the application and provide the path to `.py` file when prompted.

2. Review the feedback and suggestions provided by OpenAI.
