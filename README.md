## Installation
To use this application, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-code-review-tool.git
   cd python-code-review-tool


2. **Install required packages**:
   Install the `openai` package using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

3. **Set your OpenAI API Key**:
   In the `main.py` file, replace `"your.api.key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Creating an OpenAI API Key
To utilize the OpenAI API, you'll need to create an API key. Follow these steps:

1. üåê Go to the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
2. üìù Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. üîë Navigate to the **API Keys** section from the dashboard.
4. ‚ûï Click on the **Create API Key** button.
5. üìã Copy the generated API key and store it securely, as you‚Äôll need it for your application.

   
## Example
Here‚Äôs a brief example of how to use the application:

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Enter the file path**: When prompted, provide the path to your Python file. For instance:
    ```sh
    Please enter the file location: d:/github/Open_source/AI-code-review/main.py
    ```
    Replace it with the full file path of your code.
    
3. **Feedback from OpenAI**: The tool will analyze the code and output feedback like this:
   ```
   The code you provided seems well-written and efficient.
   However, I noticed that you could use the `f-string` format for better readability.
   ```
## Common Use Cases
1. **Reviewing code for efficiency**: Utilize the tool to identify areas where your code can be optimized for better performance.
    ```sh
    Please enter the file location: inefficient_code.py
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Feedback from OpenAI:
    The code you provided could be optimized by utilizing a more efficient algorithm. Consider using [Algorithm suggestion] instead of the current approach.
    ```
    
2. **Checking code style**: Ensure your code adheres to best practices and coding conventions for readability and maintainability.
    ```sh
    Please enter the file location: poorly_styled_code.py
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Feedback from OpenAI:
    The code style could be improved by adhering to PEP 8 guidelines. For example, consider using more descriptive variable names and consistent indentation.
    ```

3. **Analyzing code for error handling**: Evaluate how well your code manages potential exceptions and provides robust error handling.
    ```sh
    Please enter the file location: code_with_error_handling.py
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Feedback from OpenAI:
    The code has good error-handling practices implemented. You've effectively used try-except blocks to manage potential exceptions.
    ```
4. **Generating test cases**: Ask the tool to suggest appropriate test cases for your code to ensure its functionality and correctness.
    ```sh
    Please enter the file location: my_function.py
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Feedback from OpenAI:
    Here are some test cases you could consider for your function: [Suggested test cases]
    ```

5. **Debugging code**: Use the tool to identify potential bugs or logical errors in your code.
    ```sh
    Please enter the file location: buggy_code.py
     ```
    Output:
    ```
    Feedback from OpenAI:
    I noticed a potential issue in your code on line [Line number]. Consider [Suggestion for improvement] to address this.
    ```

## Error Handling:
1. **File not found**: If the provided file path is incorrect, you'll see an error message like:
    ```python
    Error: The file 'invalid_path.py' was not found.
    ```
    Make sure to enter the correct path to the file.


2. **API key issues**: If the API key is invalid or missing, you might encounter an error message like:
   ```python
   Invalid API Key provided.
   ```
   Double-check that you have entered the correct API key in the `main.py` file.

3. **Rate limit exceeded**: If you exceed your OpenAI usage limit, you'll get a message:
    ```
    Sorry, you have exceeded your current usage limit. Please visit platform.openai.com to upgrade your plan.
    ```
   You can upgrade your plan or reduce your usage to continue using the tool.
